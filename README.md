Open code - Profitability of condition monitoring sensors

# Goal
This code in Python aims at assessing whether installing sensors would result in economic savings that would compensate the investment costs.
We consider a population of lines and aim to identify the lines where sensors would be profitable. Available data are line characteristics, especially the number of clients supplied by the line, and costs for line corrective and condition-based maintenance, and costs of sensor installation and operation. We assume here that sensors and methods that use sensor measurements to evaluate the component's condition are relatively reliable. 

# Technologies
This code has been developed and run with Python 3.7.

# Launch
The code is composed of 1 file: "main.py". There are no dataset attached.
Adapting the path ("os.chdir") to the user's directory location is needed.
