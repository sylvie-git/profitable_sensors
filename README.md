# profitable_sensors
Open code - Profitability of condition monitoring sensors

# Goal
* This code in Python aims at assessing whether installing sensors would result in economic savings that would compensate the investment costs.
* We consider a population of lines and aim to identify the lines where sensors would be profitable. 
* Needed data are line characteristics, especially the number of clients supplied by the line, and costs for line corrective and condition-based maintenance, and costs of sensor installation and operation.
* The code also enables to make sensitivity analyses related to: Weibull parameters, failure rate limit, costs, and number of clients supplied by the line.

# Technologies
This code has been developed and run with Python 3.7.

# Launch
The code is composed of 1 file: "main.py". There are no dataset attached.
Adapting the path ("os.chdir") to the user's directory location is needed.
